           <dt><h2>Introduction to Data and Database</h2></dt>
           <dd>In this chapter we will learn about what is data and what is database what is management why we need to do management and importance of Data </dd>
           <hr>
          <dt><h2>Datatypes</h2></dt>
           <dd>In this chapter SQL data types define the kind of values that columns can hold in a database. They ensure data accuracy and efficiency. Examples include INTEGER (whole numbers), VARCHAR(n) (variable-length strings), DECIMAL(p, s) (precise numbers with decimals), DATE (date values), BOOLEAN (true or false), and BLOB (binary data). Choosing the right data type is crucial for effective database management</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Constraints</h2></dt>
           <dd>Constraints in SQL are rules and conditions applied to tables and columns to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the data stored in a database. They prevent the entry of invalid or inconsistent data by enforcing specific rules on the data being inserted, updated, or deleted in a table.</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Commands</h2></dt>
           <dd>SQL commands are instructions. It is used to communicate with the database. It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data. SQL can perform various tasks like create a table, add data to tables, drop the table, modify the table, set permission for users.</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Operators</h2></dt>
           <dd>An operator is a reserved word or a character that is used to query our database in a SQL expression. To query a database using operators, we use a WHERE clause. Operators are necessary to define a condition in SQL, as they act as a connector between two or more conditions.</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Functions</h2></dt>
           <dd>Aggregate functions: These functions are used to do operations from the values of the column and a single value is returned. AVG() COUNT() FIRST() LAST() MAX() MIN()
               Scalar functions: These functions are based on user input, these too returns single value. UCASE() LCASE() MID() LEN() ROUND() NOW()</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Clauses</h2></dt>
           <dd>Clause in SQL is a built-in function that is used to retrieve the data from the records present in the database. Different clauses in SQL are used to fetch or retrieve the records from the database table. The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to arrange the retrieved results in ascending order or descending order.</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Subqueries</h2></dt>
           <dd>In SQL a Subquery can be simply defined as a query within another query. In other words we can say that a Subquery is a query that is embedded in WHERE clause of another SQL query. Important rules for Subqueries: You can place the Subquery in a number of SQL clauses: WHERE clause, HAVING clause, FROM clause.</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Joins</h2></dt>
           <dd>The SQL JOIN is a command clause that combines records from two or more tables in a database. It is a means of combining data in fields from two tables by using values common to each table. If you're working with databases, at some point in your work you will likely need to use SQL JOINs.</dd>
           <hr>
           <dt><h2>Normalization</h2></dt>
           <dd>Normalization is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table. Normalization also helps to organize the data in the database. It is a multi-step process that sets the data into tabular form and removes the duplicated data from the relational tables.</dd>
